# Feature Specification: Czech National Bank Currency Exchange App

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-simple`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a simple app, which:

1. When it starts, retrieve the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank.

API URL: https://www.cnb.cz/en/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-market/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/daily.txt

Documentation: https://www.cnb.cz/en/faq/Format-of-the-foreign-exchange-market-rates/

2. Parses the downloaded data and clearly displays a list to the user in the UI.

3. Add a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after submitting (clicking a button or in real-time) sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to view current currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank and convert Czech Koruna (CZK) amounts to other currencies, so I can quickly understand the value of my money in different currencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is launched, **When** the app starts, **Then** it must automatically fetch and display the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank
2. **Given** the currency exchange rates are displayed, **When** I enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, **Then** I must see the converted amount in the selected currency
3. **Given** the currency exchange rates are displayed, **When** the Czech National Bank data is unavailable, **Then** the app must display an appropriate error message to the user

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Czech National Bank API is down or returns an error?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues during data retrieval?
- What happens when the user enters an invalid or non-numeric amount?
- How does the system handle outdated exchange rate data?
- What happens when no currency is selected in the conversion form?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically fetch the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank API when the application starts
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse the text format data from the Czech National Bank API and extract all available currency exchange rates
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a clear, readable list of all available currencies and their exchange rates to the user
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a form where users can input an amount in Czech Koruna (CZK)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a currency selection dropdown containing all available currencies from the fetched exchange rates
- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate and display the converted amount when a user submits the form or in real-time as they type
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle API errors gracefully and show appropriate error messages to users
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate user input to ensure only valid numeric amounts are accepted for conversion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Currency Exchange Rate**: Represents the exchange rate between Czech Koruna (CZK) and a foreign currency, including currency code, currency name, and exchange rate value
- **Currency Conversion Request**: Represents a user's request to convert a specific CZK amount to a selected foreign currency
- **Conversion Result**: Represents the calculated result showing the original CZK amount, target currency, exchange rate used, and converted amount
