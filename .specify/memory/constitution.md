# Miniature Journey Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-driven development MUST be the foundation of all feature implementation. All code MUST be written with testability as the primary design consideration. Unit tests MUST provide complete coverage of business logic, integration tests MUST validate system interactions, and end-to-end tests MUST verify user workflows. No code may be committed without corresponding failing tests that pass after implementation.

### II. Code Quality & Consistency
All code MUST adhere to established quality standards including consistent naming conventions, proper documentation, and clean architecture principles. Code reviews MUST validate adherence to these standards before any merge. Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed systematically, with no accumulation of critical issues. All modules MUST be loosely coupled and highly cohesive, following SOLID principles and established design patterns appropriate to the technology stack.

### III. Performance & User Experience
All features MUST meet performance benchmarks with clear targets for response times, throughput, and resource utilization. User interfaces MUST maintain consistent interaction patterns, visual design, and accessibility standards across all components. Performance testing MUST be integrated into the development pipeline, with continuous monitoring of key metrics. System responsiveness MUST remain within acceptable thresholds even under peak load conditions.

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: MUST cover all business logic with minimum 80% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: MUST validate all service interactions and data flows
- **Contract Tests**: MUST enforce API compatibility and prevent breaking changes
- **Performance Tests**: MUST validate against established performance benchmarks
- **Accessibility Tests**: MUST ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all user interfaces

### Code Review Process
- All code changes MUST pass automated quality checks
- Peer review MUST be completed by at least one team member
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed before deployment
- Performance impact MUST be assessed and documented

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- API endpoints MUST respond within 200ms under normal load
- User interface interactions MUST complete within 100ms
- Database queries MUST execute within 50ms for common operations
- Background processing MUST complete within specified SLA timeframes

### Resource Utilization
- Memory usage MUST remain within allocated limits
- CPU utilization MUST not exceed 80% under peak load
- Network bandwidth MUST be optimized for efficient data transfer
- Storage usage MUST be monitored and optimized regularly

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and MUST be followed by all team members. Amendments require unanimous approval from the technical leadership team, with clear documentation of changes and migration plans. All pull requests MUST include compliance validation against these principles. Complex architectural decisions MUST be justified with reference to these constitutional principles.

Compliance MUST be verified through automated checks in the development pipeline, with regular audits of adherence to these standards. Technical debt MUST be tracked and prioritized based on impact to constitutional compliance.
